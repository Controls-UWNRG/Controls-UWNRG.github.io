				<div id="emma_txt">EMMA (ElectroMagnetic Micro Actuation) is our most known project. It placed 3rd overall in the 2010 NIST Mobile Microrobotics Challenge in Alaska and the 2014 Mobile Microrobotics Challenge in Hong Kong, China. In the 2011 competition in Shanghai, China, we had an astonishing first place finish in the microassembly challenge. <br><br>EMMA, which is composed of a nickel-cobalt-magnese-phosphorus alloy, works through magnetic actuation. By displacing the magnetic field surrounding the robot, it is possible to obtain movement in the desired direction with sub-micron precision. EMMA has been retired as of 2014 and has been replaced by SAM as our primary competition microrobot.</div>

				The purpose of the MICHELLE (Mercury In a Clear Habitat Enclosure Leveraging Lorentz Excitation) design is to create a microfluidic robot that can be accurately moved around a field filled with another fluid medium to participate in ICRA challenges. The MICHELLE project functions based on the principle of Lorentz excitation, where a magnetic field applied perpendicularly to a current-carrying wire will provide a force perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field. Using this principle, we propose to run an electrical current through a conductive fluid such as mercury using two parallel conductive plates so that it can be manipulated by magnetic actuators to control its movement in a planar field. Our future plans include reviewing safety standards and procedures for safe handling of the mercury, constructing a proof-of-concept apparatus for the design, and preparing for new recruits.

				One of our newest projects, SAM (Solenoid Actuated Microrobot) was created specifically for competition. SAM is a square prism made of a ferromagnetic photoresist. She is composed mainly of iron oxide particles suspended in SU-8 photoresist. The control mechanism is a set of five solenoids, four placed around the robot to ensure motion in the x and y plane, with a fifth underneath to act as a breaking mechanism, allowing SAM to move in discrete steps. By pulsing the solenoids, SAM can be manoeuvered quickly and precisely.

				Utilizing acoustic waves as propulsion for a MEMS device, UW_NRG's surface acoustic wave team (known as SAW) is attempting to diversify the group's arsenal of microrobotic achievements. The design for SAW was initially conceived following our success in the 2011 NIST Mobile Microrobotics Challenge, and features the group's first entirely fluid microrobot design. The design consists of a nanolitre fluid droplet, moving atop a silicon substrate that has been patterned into an interdigitated transducer. A silicon wafer layered with zinc oxide and aluminum thin films will be developed into the surface acoustic wave generator, which will produce oscillations on the wafer surface. This will yield an excited fluid droplet, and ultimately result in linear propulsion of the fluid microrobot.
