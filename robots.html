It placed 3rd overall in the 2010 NIST Mobile Microrobotics Challenge in Alaska and the 2014 Mobile Microrobotics Challenge in Hong Kong, China. In the 2011 competition in Shanghai, China, we had an astonishing first place finish in the microassembly challenge.EMMA, which is composed of a nickel-cobalt-magnese-phosphorus alloy, works through magnetic actuation. By displacing the magnetic field surrounding the robot, it is possible to obtain movement in the desired direction with sub-micron precision. EMMA has been retired as of 2014 and has been replaced by SAM as our primary competition microrobot.</p>

SAM is a square prism made of a ferromagnetic photoresist. She is composed mainly of iron oxide particles suspended in SU-8 photoresist. The control mechanism is a set of five solenoids, four placed around the robot to ensure motion in the x and y plane, with a fifth underneath to act as a breaking mechanism, allowing SAM to move in discrete steps. By pulsing the solenoids, SAM can be manoeuvered quickly and precisely.</p>

                    <p class="inner">The purpose of the MICHELLE (Mercury In a Clear Habitat Enclosure Leveraging Lorentz Excitation) design is to create a microfluidic robot that can be accurately moved around a field filled with another fluid medium to participate in ICRA challenges. The MICHELLE project functions based on the principle of Lorentz excitation, where a magnetic field applied perpendicularly to a current-carrying wire will provide a force perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field. Using this principle, we propose to run an electrical current through a conductive fluid such as mercury using two parallel conductive plates so that it can be manipulated by magnetic actuators to control its movement in a planar field. Our future plans include reviewing safety standards and procedures for safe handling of the mercury, constructing a proof-of-concept apparatus for the design, and preparing for new recruits.</p>

The design for SAW was initially conceived following our success in the 2011 NIST Mobile Microrobotics Challenge, and features the group's first entirely fluid reverse-piezoelectric microrobot design. The design consists of a nanolitre fluid droplet, moving atop a silanized glass substrate that has been patterned into an interdigitated transducer. A lithium niobate wafer layered with titanium and gold thin films will be act as a surface acoustic wave generator, which will produce oscillations on the wafer surface. This will yield an excited fluid droplet, and ultimately result in linear propulsion of the fluid microrobot.</p>

                        The ICRA Micro-Assembly Challenge consists of using a microrobot to position several microscopic triangles into a specific formation. MAYA was designed specifically to complete this challenge. The idea behind MAYA is to use quantum locking, a phenomenon exhibited by thin film superconductors, to precisely control the robot's position. Quantum locking happens due to a superconductor's tendency to stay in place when it is exposed to a magnetic field. The material is held in place by the field concentrating at defects in the superconducting film. Thus by modifying the field we can move a robot coated in a thin film of superconducting YBCO in all six axes. MAYA will hover over the triangles and manipulate them using a simple claw. This allows for unparalleled control, and ensures fast and effective completion of the assembly challenge.
